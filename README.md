   # Click-Score App
   

#### *Project Description*
   
   This project is a simple React-based web application where users can test their clicking speed. The app features a timer, score tracking, and a high score history that is stored locally. Additionally, users can toggle between dark and light modes.
   


   
   ## Features
   - **Timer and Score Tracking:** Start a timer and see how many times you can click the button before time runs out.
   - **High Score History:** View your highest scores along with the date and time. The scores are saved locally, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
   - **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark modes to match your visual preferences.
   - **Button Animation:** The click button has a satisfying animation effect, simulating a press-down into the surface.
